              - Hypertext Markup Language commonly referred to, as HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets like &lt;html&gt;. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &lt;img&gt;. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
            </p>
          <div class="lesson-subject">URLs</div> 
            <p> 
              - Uniform Resource Locator is a reference to a resource that specifies the location of the resource on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of uniform resource identifier although many people use the two terms interchangeably.  A URL implies the means to access an indicated resource, which is not true of every URL.  URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.
            </p>
          <div class="lesson-subject">HTTP</div> 
            <p>
              - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.  HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks) between nodes containing text. HTTP is the protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.

                  - An inline element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define the inline element.   Inline elements normally displayed without line breaks.

               <div class="lesson-subject">Block</div>
                <p>
                  - A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block."  Normally start (and end) with a new line, when displayed in a browser.
                </p>
               <div class="lesson-subject">Inline Examples</div>
               <p>
                    &lt;b>text &lt;/b> - inserts new line
                  <br>
                    &lt;td> - defines a standard cell in an HTML table.  
                  <br>
                    &lt;img> - defines an image in an HTML page.

                <p>
                    &lt;div>&lt;/div> - defines a division or a section in an HTML document (block-level).
                 <br>&lt;p>text &lt;/p> - defines a paragraph
                 <br>&lt;h1>&lt;/h1> - defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

              <div class="lesson-subject">Tree Like Structures</div> 
                <p>
                  - is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a "tree structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree, even though the chart is generally upside down compared to an actual tree, with the "root" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.
                </p>
                <div class="lesson-subject">HTML and CSS are both Languages</div> 
                <p>
                  - Language of HTML is Tag HTML controls the "structure" of a web page CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks) DOM - Document Object Model which is a standard convention of representing and interacting with elements in HTML
               </p>

                <div class="lesson-subject">CSS and Repetition</div> 
                <p>
                  - One of the many benefits of CSS files are helping with repetition of code .  CSS allows you to move a great deal of information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.
                  CSS allows the separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles such as the speed and emphasis with which text is read out by aural text readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.
               </p>

              <div class="lesson-subject">Text Editors (for programming):</div>
               <p>
                - When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.
               </p> 
              <div class="lesson-subject">Trouble Shooting:</div> 
               <p>
                  1. Collect evidence (what makes this program fail?).
                  <br>2. Generate theories (what may have caused this problem?).
                  <br>3. Test those theories (if my theory is correct, how could I find out?).
                  <br>4. Fix the problem.

             <p>
              - Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. While most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.

            <div class="lesson-subject">Inheritance</div>
             <p>
               - Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants.  It relies on the document tree.
             </p>   

            <div class="lesson-subject">Properties that can be inherited</div> 
            <p>
              - Are color, font, letter spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white space and word spacing. 
            </p>
            <div class="lesson-subject">Properties that cannot be inherited </div> 
            <p>
              -Are background, border, display, float and clear, height and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index

              1. Look for natural boxes
              <br>2.Look for repeated styles and semantic elements
              <br>3. Write your HTML
              <br>4. Apply your styles
              <br>5. Fix things (from biggest to smallest)
